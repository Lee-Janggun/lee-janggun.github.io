I am a **Ph.D Student at KAIST [School of Computing](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr)** at [CASYS Lab](https://casyslab.kaist.ac.kr/), supervised by [Jongse Park](https://jongse-park.github.io/).

My interest lies in formal verification low-level concurrent data structures and systems.
I am especially interested in modular and automatic verification of them using separation logic such as [Iris](https://iris-project.org).

Currently, I am looking into verification of out-of-order multicore processors.
