I am a **Ph.D Student at KAIST [School of Computing](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr)** at [Concurrency and Parallelism Laboratory]({{ site.baseurl }}/).

My interest lies in formal verfication low-level concurrent data structures and systems.
I am especially interested in modular and automatic verification of them using separation logic such as [Iris](https://iris-project.org).
